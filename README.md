# docker-compose-testing
Testing multiple containers under a single service using Docker Compose

We would need to import and then create a container for the same - Python Flask and Redis. NOTE: These images are pulled by docker itself once we mention it in the Dockerfile.

# Command
$ docker-compose up

(or)

$ docker-compose up -d
